## Frameworks and Language Used

- **Java**: The primary programming language used for developing the application.
- **Spring Boot**: A framework built on top of the Spring framework, providing rapid application development features for creating stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.
- **MySQL**: A popular relational database management system used for storing and managing ecommerce data.
- **Swagger UI**: An open-source tool that generates a user-friendly interface for interacting with the API endpoints.

## Dataflow

The ecommerce API follows the following data flow:

1. **Client Interaction**: The client, such as a web browser or a mobile app, sends HTTP requests to the server for ecommerce operations, including browsing products, adding items to the cart, placing orders, etc.

2. **Controller Layer**: In the Spring Boot application, the incoming HTTP requests are handled by the Controller layer. The Controller receives the requests and delegates them to the appropriate methods in the service layer.

3. **Service Layer**: The Service layer contains the business logic of the application and handles ecommerce operations. When a request is received from the Controller, the Service layer performs the necessary actions. For example, when placing an order, the Service layer validates the input data, interacts with the data access layer, and performs any required calculations or business rules.

4. **Data Access Layer**: The Data Access layer is responsible for interacting with the MySQL database to perform CRUD operations on ecommerce data. It uses SQL queries to retrieve, update, insert, or delete data from the database.

5. **Database**: The MySQL database stores ecommerce data, including product information, user details, orders, etc.

6. **Response**: After the data operation is completed, the response flows back through the layers in the reverse order. The Service layer receives the response from the Data Access layer, performs any necessary post-processing or formatting, and sends it back to the Controller.

7. **Controller Response**: The Controller layer receives the response from the Service layer and returns an appropriate HTTP response to the client, indicating the success or failure of the requested operation.

## Data Structure

1. **Product Model**: The Product model represents the data structure for storing product information. It typically includes attributes such as ID, name, description, price, etc.

2. **Order Model**: The Order model represents the data structure for storing order information. It typically includes attributes such as ID, user details, product details, total amount, etc.

3. **User Model**: The User model represents the data structure for storing user information. It typically includes attributes such as ID, name, email, address, etc.

4. **Address Model**: The Address model represents the data structure for storing address information. It typically includes attributes such as ID, street, city, state, postal code, etc.

## Project Summary

The Ecommerce API is designed to provide functionality for managing an ecommerce platform. It includes features such as browsing products, adding items to the cart, placing orders, managing user information, and more. The application is built using Spring Boot and uses MySQL as the database for storing ecommerce data. The API endpoints can be explored and tested using Swagger UI.

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Java, Maven, and MySQL installed.
3. Set up the database configuration in the application.properties file.
4. Run the application using Maven or your preferred IDE.
5. Access the API endpoints using Swagger UI by navigating to the appropriate URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`).

## Database

The Ecommerce API uses MySQL as the database to store ecommerce data. You need to create a MySQL database and configure the connection details in the application.properties file. The application will automatically create the necessary tables based on the defined data structure.
